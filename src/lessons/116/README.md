# Reveal Suspense Components in Order with SuspenseList's revealOrder Prop

`revealOrder` is one of `SuspenseList`s configuration options. It can be undefined, `together`, `forwards`, and `backwards`.

- `undefined` (default): reveal children as suspenders resolve
- `together`: reveal children together, once all suspenders are resolved
- `forwards`: render children from top to bottom, indifferent to suspender resolution order
- `backwards`: render children from bottom to top, indifferent to suspender resolution order
