# Delay the Appearance of a Loading Spinner with CSS

Eager delay spinners are not a good user experience.  
They can make a snappy user interface feel slower.

We want delay spinners to appear only after a perceivable delay.  
`useTransition` doesn't yet have an API for customizing this.  
Until it does, we can use CSS animations to delay visibility of delay spinners.

## Exercise

We have here a component that show ...
And it shows a DelaySpinner that is really helpful with slow internet speeds.
But when we speed it up, we see this unsettling effect.

The spinner pops in for a split second with EVERY SINGLE REQUEST.
That's not necessry or pleasent.

Again, we can fix this and React has a great article on this technique on the Concurrent docs â€” doc name.

describe

So let's copy it and add it to our own component.

Show online, fast, and slow

Now that this is fleshed out.
Let's move it into a new module for shared ui.
